# Pytorch-implementation-of-DeepRegressionForests
This is a pytorch version implementation of the caffe-DeepRegressionForests for age estimation.

# Original Paper and Code
Original Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07195
Original Code: https://github.com/shenwei1231/caffe-DeepRegressionForests
The original version utilize the caffe to implement the whole project, which needs a lot of effort to implement the conv functions. I decided to reimplement the algorithm with pytorch version code

# Dataset 
In this project, I decided to use FGNET for a light training process. You can preprocess the dataset with readData.py

# Training
You can train the model by train.py
